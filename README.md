# transcriptic_public_protocols

I'm going to collect my public protocols here, written in Autoprotocol for the [Transcriptic](https://transcriptic.com) platform.

PR's very welcome :+1:.

## Protocols:

1. **Spread N' Pick** - Takes up to 6 bacteria samples, plates them, then picks up to 8 colonies for each plated sample, then cultures them in liquid broth giving the user a ```96-deep``` container with the liquid cultures of the colonies.

2. **Serial Dilute Plus** - Takes a sample and dilutes it in your choice of media (from the reagent dispensing list). You can specify the dilution factor. Max dilutions is currently 8. Also the original concentration of the sample is plated, only the dilutions.

3. **Glycerol Storage** - Takes an aliquot adds 500µL to 500µL of 40% glycerol stores the `micro-1.5` at -80C. For the storage of bacterial stocks.
