# transcriptic_public_protocols

I'm going to collect my public protocols here, written in Autoprotocol for the [Transcriptic](https://transcriptic.com) platform.
PR's welcome for improving the code quality.

## Protocols:

1. **Spread N' Pick** - Takes up to 6 bacteria samples, plates them, then picks up to 8 colonies for each plated sample, then cultures them in liquid broth giving the user a ```96-deep``` container with the liquid cultures of the colonies.
